# brightspace-markdown-formatter
Grabs the content from Brightspace downloads and converts the html to markdown so you can read it in one file. Based off structure from VU so your mileage may vary.

It cleans up the html, gets rid of js, converts it to markdown, removes some lines, puts it into numbered directories and combines it into one file.

Why? I can't stand the staged reading of small text and embedded video in small sections when you can speed read and use AI drivern summaries on 6 weeks of coursework.

TODO: Where Text alternate exists, grab the html, convert to md, insert into file.
